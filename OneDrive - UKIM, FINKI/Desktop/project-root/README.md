"# DIZAJN PROEKT" 

Needed technologies:
1.Intelij
2.WebStorm with installed node.js dependencies

To check functionality of the project after running it in Intelij in the browser go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.jsp in the "JDBC URL:" put this "jdbc:h2:file:~/data/demo" in the "User Name:" put "dasdom" and in the "Password:" put "Finki123" (without " " on the password and user name and name of the URL). After connecting to the database run SELECT * FROM ISSUERS and u will get the table for the Issuers. After this if its all correct u will go to http://localhost:8080/api/issuers and u will see all the Issuers in a JSON format. From this point u are ready to go to WebStorm and run the front end u will have to npm install and start the server and it will open ur application on ur default browser.
